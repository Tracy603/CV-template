					<h1>Personal Profile</h1>
				</div>
				
				<div class="sectionContent">
					<p>Technical Writer & Instructional Designer:  
						<br>I bring more than twenty years of experience as an educator, writer, administrator, and project manager in academia to my new career in technical writing and instructional design.  My areas of expertise include:
					<ul class="BulletList">
						<li>Writing for audiences at all levels of knowledge and sophistication</li>
						<li>Communicating complex concepts in understandable, user-friendly language</li>
						<li>Designing instructional documents and experiences customized for the end user</li>
					</ul>

					<br>
					<br>As a teacher and university professor I pursued a mission to make learning math more interesting and accessible to a broader range of students, and in the process eliminate the confusion and insecurity that lead to the math anxiety and avoidance that plagues far too many adults.
					<br>
					<br>To that end, my work –research, teaching, and writing – focused on strategies to help students easily understand the logic and reasoning behind the computational algorithms.  In other words, understand the why in addition to the how.

					<br>
					<br>My goal is to now transfer those skills for analytic thinking and precise communication to the field of technical writing and/or instructional design.

					<h2>Consultant & Project Manager, Tufts University & Wentworth Institute of Technology</h2>
					<p class="subDetails">2011-2013</p>
					<p>
Tufts University:
	Independently initiated and managed a complex 18-month project culminating in the College of Arts & Sciences (A&S) assessment report for the university’s ten-year accreditation application.  
					
	<ul class="BulletList">
		
		<li>Overcame the faculty’s resistance, and in some cases outright hostility, toward the project by showing them how to make the required research projects both meaningful and manageable (change management).
		<li>Provided ideas and guidance for each of the 129 degree program directors as they conducted the research, completed the documentation, and gathered the artifacts required for the program portfolio.  In some cases the guidance required friendly, but persistent, nudging.
		<li>Wrote concise, easily understood instructional documents.
		<li>Designed efficient report documents that were quick and easy for faculty to complete and accreditation personnel to review.
		<li>Created and managed a user-friendly, easy-to-navigate project website that housed over 30,000 documents and artifacts. 
		<li>Created and maintained project tracking strategies that provided an accurate status update for each of the 129 projects in real time.
		<li>Wrote the final 40-page College of Arts & Sciences assessment report. 
		
	</ul>

Wentworth Institute of Technology:  
		
	<ul class="BulletList">
		
		<li>Saved WIT from losing its accreditation status. This threat was the result of the institution’s failure to meet requirements and deadlines.
		<li>Worked directly with the accreditation agencies to identify acceptable remedial actions, and, working with faculty and administration, met those requirements within the negotiated timeframe.
		<li>To prevent future threats to accreditation, developed a 5-year plan of action that included a portfolio of organized procedures, timelines, and deliverables for each of the 21 accrediting agencies.
